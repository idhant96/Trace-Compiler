Helped in designing the grammar for the compiler. Researched on the Lexical Parser(Tokenization) part of the compiler. Using python to tokenize the string part of the compiler. Using python to run prolog files which execute the tokenized string list we generated. After phase 1 part of the project, I plan to use a tool for lexical parsing the input program.
